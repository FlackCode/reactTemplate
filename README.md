# React + Vite + Tailwind

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, some ESLint rules AND TailwindCSS.

(template made by Flack based on the Vite default React template).

# Getting started:
Only requirements are Node and Git installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/FlackCode/reactTemplate
cd reactTemplate
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install react-icons
npm run dev
```
Run this in your Visual Studio Code to begin!

I will keep adding on to the install code when i find some useful features that i use often!

Bun verson:
```
git clone https://github.com/FlackCode/reactTemplate
cd reactTemplate
bun install
